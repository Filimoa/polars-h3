This is a [Polars](https://docs.pola.rs/) extension that adds support for the [H3 discrete global grid system](https://github.com/uber/h3/), so you can index points and geometries to hexagons directly in Polars. All credits goes to the [h3o](https://github.com/HydroniumLabs/h3o) for doing the heavy lifting.

# Highlights

- 🚀 **Blazing Fast:** Built entirely in Rust, offering vectorized, multi-core H3 operations within Polars. Ideal for high-performance data processing.
  - 25X faster than [h3-py](https://github.com/uber/h3-py)
  - 5X faster than [H3 DuckDB](https://github.com/isaacbrodsky/h3-duckdb) *(See [notebook](notebooks/benchmarking.ipynb) for more details)*

- 🌍 **H3 Feature Parity:** Comprehensive support for H3 functions, covering almost everything the standard H3 library provides, excluding geometric functions.

- 📋 **Fully Tested:** Accurately tested against the standard H3 library.

- 🔍 **Data Type Agnostic:** Supports string and integer H3 indexes natively, eliminating format conversion hassles.

# Get started

You can get started by installing it with pip (or [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)):
```bash
pip install polars-h3
```

You can use the extension as a drop-in replacement for the standard H3 functions.

```python
import polars_h3 as plh3
import polars as pl
 
>>> df = pl.DataFrame(
...     {
...         "lat": [37.7749],
...         "long": [-122.4194],
...     }
... ).with_columns(
...     plh3.latlng_to_cell(
...         "lat",
...         "long",
...         resolution=7,
...         return_dtype=pl.Utf8
...     ).alias("h3_cell"),
... )
>>> df
shape: (1, 3)
┌─────────┬───────────┬─────────────────┐
│ lat     ┆ long      ┆ h3_cell         │

│ f64     ┆ f64       ┆ str             │

# Implemented functions

This extension implements most of the [H3 API](https://h3geo.org/docs/api/indexing). The full list of functions is below.

> ⚠️ **Performance Note:** When possible, prefer using `pl.UInt64` for H3 indices instead of the `pl.Utf8` representation. String representations require casting operations which impact performance. Working directly with the native 64-bit integer format provides better computational efficiency.

We are unable to support the functions that work with geometries.

### Plotting

The library also comes with helper functions to plot hexes on a Folium map.


```python
import polars_h3 as pl_h3
import polars as pl

hex_map = pl_h3.graphing.plot_hex_outlines(df, "h3_cell")
display(hex_map)

# or if you have a metric to plot

hex_map = pl_h3.graphing.plot_hex_fills(df, "h3_cell", "metric_col")
display(hex_map)
```

### Development

It's recommended to use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage the extension dependencies. If you modify rust code, you will need to run  `uv run maturin develop --uv` to see changes. If you're looking to benchmark the performance of the extension, build the release version with `maturin develop --release --uv` and then run `uv run -m benchmarks.engine` (assuming you have the benchmark dependencies installed). Benchmarking with the development version will lead to misleading results.
