# h3-polars

This is a [Polars](https://docs.pola.rs/) extension that adds support for the [H3 discrete global grid system](https://github.com/uber/h3/), so you can index points and geometries to hexagons in SQL.

# Get started

Load from the [community extensions repository](https://community-extensions.duckdb.org/extensions/h3.html):
```SQL
INSTALL h3 FROM community;
LOAD h3;
```

Test running an H3 function:
```SQL
SELECT h3_cell_to_latlng('822d57fffffffff');
```

Or, using the integer API, which generally has better performance:
```SQL
SELECT h3_cell_to_latlng(586265647244115967);
```

# Implemented functions

This extension implements the entire [H3 API](https://h3geo.org/docs/api/indexing). The full list of functions is below.

All functions support H3 indexes specified as `UBIGINT` (`uint64`) or `BIGINT` (`int64`),
but the unsigned one is preferred and is returned when the extension can't detect which
one to use. The unsigned and signed APIs are identical. All functions also support
`VARCHAR` H3 index input and output.
